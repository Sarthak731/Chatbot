# Chatbot
This project is a basic web-based chatbot implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot allows users to interact with it through a simple conversational interface that simulates a typical chatbot response system. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend technologies to create an engaging user experience.

Key Features:

User Interface (UI): The chatbot interface is designed using HTML and styled with CSS for a clean, intuitive, and responsive layout. The chat window includes a message area where the conversation is displayed and an input field for users to type their messages.

Interactive Conversations: JavaScript is used to handle user inputs and generate appropriate bot responses. A predefined set of responses is stored in the script to simulate intelligent conversation. The bot can respond to greetings, simple questions, and specific keywords or phrases.

Responsive Design: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technical Stack:

HTML: Provides the structure of the chatbot, including the chat window, message bubbles, and input fields.

CSS: Styles the chatbot, making the interface visually appealing with colors, fonts, and layout adjustments.

JavaScript: Handles user input, generates bot responses, and manages the flow of conversation by appending messages to the chat window dynamically.

Project Objectives:

To build a simple, yet interactive chatbot interface.
To practice frontend development skills by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
To explore basic JavaScript logic for creating responsive chat experiences.
This project is an excellent introduction to building interactive web applications using core web technologies, making it a good starting point for further chatbot or frontend development projects.
